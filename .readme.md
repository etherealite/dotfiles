# Dotfiles Information


## TODO
1. automate install of apt packages from [workstation.yml](.local/share/worksation.yml)

2. allow passwordless login for sshd
append necesary config line to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`,
might need to add something like:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
``` 

3. Install SAMBA and configure a no password share in home directory for sharing files with the host when running a VM.

4. Install FZF and integrate with shell great [examples](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Examples#z) of what it can do.

5. Automate setting up passwordless sudo for the %sudo user group.

6. Install [http-prompt](https://github.com/eliangcs/http-prompt) to replace something like Postman.

7. Try out the ranger file manager

8. setup `fasd` command and in FZF, you can combine with Ranger

9. setup [dynamic-colors](https://github.com/sos4nt/dynamic-colors) for on the fly terminal color switching of solarized in the terminal.

10. Auto generate this document with something like sphinx.

11. setup ngrok free account and install client


## Reference

Great [list](https://github.com/grawity/dotfiles/blob/master/.dotfiles.notes) of shell hacks to force applications to use the XDG directories. Also includes applications already xdg capable

## Instructions

### Automatic
WHP - Run the .setup.sh script and answer the on screen questions. 

### Manual
Install the YADM dotfiles manager from either the Ubuntu APT repository or download it from Github. In both cases you need to have git available on your system for yadm to work.


Install using APT:
```shell
$ apt install yadm
```

Install by downloading from Github:
```shell
$ wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/master/yadm"

$ chomd u+x yadm && mv yadm ~/.local/bin
```
If you download from Github, be sure to have ~/.local/bin in your $PATH variable for it to work.

Once you have YADM working the next step is to clone the dot file repository by running:
```shell
$ yadm clone "git@github.com:<account>/<repo>.git"
```

YADM will attempt to merge your tracked dotfiles with the ones already in your home directory. 

Check the state of the files using normal git commands but with `yadm` inplace of `git`:
```shell
$ yadm status
```

To overwrite the existing files with those tracked in the repository issue:
```ssh
yadm reset --hard
```
**Warning**, this will irreversibly overwrite anything you have that conflicts with what is tracked in the git repository.

- [.config/](.config) - Location for configuration files in the XDG spec.

- [.mybashrc](.mybashrc) - Bash init file that wont be overwritten by the system like is common with a `.bashrc` file.

- [.shell.rc](.shell.rc) - Common configuration that is compatbile accross most shells. Works with BASH and ZSH.

- [.vimrc](.vimrc) - Vim configuration that is compatible with both VIM and VI compatibility mode.

- [.xdgvars](.xdgvars) - Implementation of the XDG or Base Directory Specification.

- [.xinitrc](.xinitrc) - This file is evaluated when starting Xorg with the `startx` command.

- [.Xmodmap](.Xmodmap) - For modifying keyboard mappings in Xorg.

- [.Xresources](.Xresources) - Options for applications that read their configuration from Xorg like rxvt-unicode.

- [.zshrc](.zshrc) - Init file for ZSH shell.


## Files in XDG Directories

### [.local/](.local) - This is the location for all non cache user data by XDG respecting applications.

- [bin/](.local/bin) - This directory is for user binaries and is added to the $PATH variable.

- [share/](.local/share) -  This is a directory for storing non user configurable data.

    - [workstation.sh](.local/share/workstation.sh) - DEPRECATED - Shell script to install ansible and install the system with a playbook
    - [workstation.yml](.local/share/workstation.yml) - DEPRECATED - Ansible playbook to install the system.



### [.config/](.config) - Location for configuration files in the XDG spec.

- [tmux.conf](.config/tmux.conf) - Confuration file for the TMUX terminal multiplexer. Not native - enabled with a shell alias in the .xdgvars file.

- [.my.cnf](.config/my.cnf) - MYSQL client configuration file. Not Native - needs an env variable that is set int .xdgvars file.

- [git/gitconfig](.config/git/gitconfig) - User name, email, aliases and settings for git. Native - Looks for `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config`

- [git/ignore](.config/git/ignore) - User name, email, aliases and settings for git. Native - looks for `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config`

- [.gemrc](.gemrc) - Keep Ruby Gems from waisting time installing docs. Not Native - Needs `$GEMRC` to be set in.

- [.inputrc](.inputrc) - Readline init file used for turning off the bell. Not Native - Needs env var `$INPUTRC` to be set.

- []

### [.local/](.local) - A user specific version of what youd typically find in something /usr/share
- [.setup.sh](.setup.sh) - This is the script used to bootstrap the yadm dotfile manager. 
TODO: Have this install needed system packages and config.

Since these are all temporary files they are not taken in consideration
